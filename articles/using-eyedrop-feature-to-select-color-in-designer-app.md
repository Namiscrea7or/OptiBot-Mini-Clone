Sometimes you need to select a color from your design or other sources to be used in your design

You can do so in Designer.

When you are using a brush, object drawing, background color selection, etc.

Click the Color Palate button, then click the Eyedrop button.

Your cursor will turn into an eyedrop crosshair. You can select anywhere on your desktop, even in a different window, applications on your desktop.

After that, you can use this color anywhere on your Design.
