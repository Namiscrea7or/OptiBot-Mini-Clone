By default, uploaded PowerPoint presentation will be played without transition or animation effect.

To use the transition, animation effects you can export your PowerPoint to MP4 video.

You can do so by Click **File** > **Export** > **Create a Video**.

Select the video quality you want, which pertains to the resolution of the finished video.

Then Upload to OptiSigns.
