Sometimes you don't want to display all templates for your users (i.e. you are a hospital and your users will not interested in the restaurant, or food templates)

You can choose what templates you want to show only by selecting them in the **Template Categories** list on the Branding page: [https://app.optisigns.com/app/s/branding-settings](https://beta.optisigns.com/app/s/branding-settings)
