Yes. You will need a 4K player such as [Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-All-New-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/), and 4K TV screens

Please be sure to have 4K content as well to take advantage of it.

You can simply upload, assign content just like any other content.
